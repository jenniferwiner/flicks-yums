# Flicks and Yums
**Front-end javascript app that expertly curates recipes to accompany any movie or tv viewing experience**

People often want to eat food while watching a movie or TV. But, there are so many options of recipes to cook. Flicks and Yums expertly curates recipes to match any show and, to top it all off, gives viewers a preview of the sentiment of the movie/show so they know what to expect.

### Feature List:
- User searches for the movie they want to watch and choses the correct option from a dropdown menu
- Flicks and Yums then pairs this movie with a curated recipe.
- Users can press the "Reyummify" button to regenerate a recipe in case they are unsatified with the current recipe or have a dietary restriction
- Lastly, users can see a smiley face that represents the sentiment of the movie (happy, neutral, sad, anguish, etc.) so they know what to expect from their viewing experience.
### Technologies Used:
- Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
- OMDb API for the movie search feature and poster display
- Edamam API for recipe integration
- Microsoft Text Anylatics for sentiment analysis of the movie's plot
- Styling with Bootstrap and CSS
