Q1 Project Retro - Flicks and Yums
-- Jennifer Winer --

What's the name of your project?
Flicks and Yums

What problem does it solve?
People often want to eat food while watching a movie or TV. But, there are so many options of recipes to cook. Flicks and Yums expertly curates recipes to match any show. It also gives viewers a preview of the sentiment of the movie/show so they know what to expect.

Who has this problem?
People who love watching movies or TV shows, who enjoy trying new recipes and who tend to be indecisive.

What web APIs did it use?
OMDb, Edamam, and Microsoft Text Analytics APIs

What technologies did it use?
HTML, CSS, Javascript
Frameworks: jQuery, Bootstrap

What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
How to expand my project and incorporate Microsoft Analytics API

What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?
The biggest challenge I had to overcome was learning to be creative with technology as my medium. This was completely new to me and required some getting used to. I still don’t feel as though I was able to overcome this challenge. There seemed to be a gap between what I thought up (ideas) and what I was capable of creating. Surprisingly, idea generating was hardest for me.

What did you do well?
I interacted with my APIs very well. I was able to access the information I wanted easily.

What would you do differently?
I would (and will) keep an idea journal so I don’t feel so rushed to pick an idea at the beginning of project week. That held me back from creating more and thinking bigger.
